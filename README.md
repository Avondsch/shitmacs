# shitmacs

Why does this exist?

Firstly, I use emacs for literally everything, and therefore now I am in a state where I can't live without it. 

What exactly does this config have?

Basically everything you need to use a computer for , ranging from:
1. An IDE
2. Email Client
4. Studying
5. Note-taking
6. Organisation suite (I have adhd)
7. pdf viewer
8. (potential) window manager (havent gone that deep yet)
