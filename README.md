# shitmacs

My very shit emacs config. 

Its got tons of stolen code, extremely finicky and weird functions, things that just arent bothering enough to be fixed and the list goes on.

I will not recommend anyone to try this clusterf**k of an emacs config, however if you do, please do at your own discretion.

The config at its heart runs on straight and use-package. It works pretty good and allows me to run weird elisp files in some random guy's git-repo without any hassle.

The text editor side has a lot of things, I run lsp, tree-sitter for the majority. For custom lisp-editing i run lispy. The editing is evil in the eyes of the church of emacs, and tbh i cant be bothered. 

other than that, its not that fancy, and its mostly just stuff that i run for my personal preference, and honestly that's why emacs exists. To build your tool the way you want it to be. 

On that note, i wish you the bery best of luck, navigating through this dumpsterfire.
